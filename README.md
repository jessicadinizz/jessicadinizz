### About me
I'm a software developer and computer engineer, and I've been working with front-end for a little over 4 years.

I spent over 3 years as a front-end developer at one of Brazil’s largest e-commerce platforms, building fast, accessible Vue/Nuxt interfaces used by millions of people.

Today I work as a front-end developer in a Brazilian team on a US/Dubai product, with a strong focus on performance, including shipping pages that reach 100/100 on Lighthouse.

I like to do Full Stack projects and mess around with Python for fun. ;)


### Main skills
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,css,js,ts,vue,react,nuxt,tailwind,sass,astro,git,docker)](https://skillicons.dev)


### Disclaimer

My commits section might look kinda empty, that's because I have separate professional Github/Gitlab pages, here you'll only find personal projects and things I do for fun :)
