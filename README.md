### Professional

I'm a software developer and computer engineer, and I’ve been working with front-end for a little over 4 years.

I spent over 3 years as a front-end developer at one of Brazil’s largest e-commerce platforms, building fast, accessible Vue/Nuxt interfaces used by millions of people.

Today I work as a front-end developer in a Brazilian team on a US/Dubai product, with a strong focus on performance, including shipping pixel-perfect pages that reach 100/100 on Lighthouse.

### Personal

If I want a software/website and can’t find any that fits what I need, I’ll build one myself. That’s how I have fun and keep coding as a hobby. :)

Besides that, I enjoy art in all shapes and ways: illustration, movies, music and especially languages.

I love learning languages, right now I speak: **PT / EN / ES / 中文**. And currently focusing on improving my Mandarim.

### 📌 Note

My commits section might look a bit empty because I have separate professional GitHub/GitLab accounts.  
Here you’ll mostly find personal projects and things I build for fun. 🙂
